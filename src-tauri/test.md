*This is the incipit of the novel.*

It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession
of a good fortune must be in want of a wife. However little known the
feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a
neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the
surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of
some one or other of their daughters.

"My dear Mr Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that
Netherfield Park is let at last?"

MrBennet replied that he had not.

"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs Long had just been here, and she
told me all about it."

Mr Bennet made no answer.

"Do not you want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.

"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."

This was invitation enough.

"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs Long says that Netherfield is taken by
a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came
down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much
delighted with it that he agreed with Mr Morris immediately; that he is
to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be
in the house by the end of next week."

"What is his name?"

"Bingley."

"Is he married or single?"

"Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or
five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"

"How so? How can it affect them?"

"My dear Mr Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You
must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."

"Is that his design in settling here?"

"Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he
may fall in love with one of them and therefore you must visit him as
soon as he comes."

"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send
them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for, as you are
as handsome as any of them, Mr Bingley might like you the best of the
party."

"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, But I
do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five
grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."

3°) Only humorous ? Explain ? What do you call that sort of text ?
Definition ?

It is all the more (=d'autant plus) shocking as/ because(=que):

-   Mrs Bennet has never met that gentleman and doesn't know if he's
    **ugly/plain**, stupid or violent.

-   she hasn't asked her daughters' opinion and they will have to
    **obey** their parents even if they disagree

-   she doesn't care which one of her daughters will get married.

-   she doesn't care about the **would-be/ potential** husband's
    personality: she is only interested in his money and his **social
    background.**

It is striking to notice that, at that time, girls were treated like
meat or like **cattle** (=bétail).

The general tone of the extract is **light** (=léger) and **humorous**.
Here, Jane Austen criticizes the fact that women are not **on an equal
footing** (=sur un pied d'égalité) with men, and are not respected. At
that time, the law in England is **prejudiced against** women and is
really **unfair**: daughters can't **inherit** their parents' property
so that Mr Bennet, with his five daughters, has to find a **suitable**
(=qui convient) husband for one of them, because, if he dies, the girls
(and Mrs Bennet) will be homeless.

1.She gave up her job when she got pregnant and now she's a HOUSEWIFE

2.They made this campaign against sexism to RAISE AWARENESS of the

3\. In the workplace, women are still DISCRIMINATED AGAINST

4\. In the 80's and 90's, women couldn't become CEOs (=PDG) : they
couldn't break the GLASS CEILING

5\. In totalitarian countries, the press is GAGGed.

3.  Je me sens impuissant. Je ne pourrai pas surmonter ces obstacles.

4.  Il est temps d'affirmer nos droits (it's high time + S+ preterit) et

IT'S HIGH TIME WE ASSERTED OUR RIGHTS AND WE STRUGGLED AGAINST MALE
CHAUVINIST PIGS OF ALL KINDS

5.  Une nouvelle génération doit prendre le relais maintenant pour

A NEW GENERATION MUST STEP UP NOW TO BRIDGE THE GENDER GAP

6.  Elles préconisent l'émancipation et défient les hommes.

THEY ADVOCATE EMPOWERMENT AND CHALLENGE MEN

So, there is no doubt that this text is humorous -- and humour comes
from/ stems from various devices (=procédés)

-   First, Mrs Bennet is a ridiculous character and the reader, like Mr
    Bennet, can easily laugh at her, because she doesn't understand her
    husband's irony and she's obsessed about marriage and money. She's
    an unbearable (= insupportable) chatter-box.

-   The contrast between the two main characters reinforces the
    impression of lightness (=légèreté) and humour: the conversation is
    like a game, a table tennis match, between the husband and the wife.

-   Mr Bennet's irony towards his wife -- especially at the end, when he
    says that his wife mustn't meet Mr Bingley because she's so
    beautiful/ pretty/ gorgeous that Mr Bingley will not notice her
    daughters but will fall in love with her.

The general tone of the extract is light (=léger) and humorous, and we
can say that the novel is a comedy of manners which lightly criticizes
the society in which the characters live.

<https://www.biography.com/activist/emmeline-pankhurst>

**Emmeline Pankhurst founded the Women's Social and Political Union,
whose members --- known as suffragettes --- fought to enfranchise women
in the United Kingdom.**

## Who Was Emmeline Pankhurst?

/ In 1903, Emmeline Pankhurst founded the Women\'s Social and Political
Union, which used militant tactics to agitate for women\'s suffrage.
Pankhurst was imprisoned many times, but supported the war effort after
World War I broke out. Parliament granted British women limited suffrage
in 1918. Pankhurst died in 1928, shortly before women were given full
voting rights.

**Early Life/** Emmeline Goulden was born in Manchester, England, on
either July 14 or 15, 1858. (Her birth certificate said July 15, but the
document wasn't filed until four months after her birth, and Goulden
always stated she was born on July 14.) Goulden, the eldest daughter of
10 children, grew up in a politically active family. Her parents were
both abolitionists and supporters of female suffrage; Goulden was 14
when her mother took her to her first women's suffrage meeting. However,
Goulden chafed at the fact that her parents prioritized their sons\'
education and advancement over hers.

**Marriage and Political Activism** /After studying in Paris, Goulden
returned to Manchester, where she met Dr. Richard Pankhurst in 1878.
Richard was a lawyer who supported a number of radical causes, including
women's suffrage. Though he was 24 years older than Goulden, the two
married in December 1879, and Goulden became Emmeline Pankhurst.Over the
next decade, Pankhurst gave birth to five children: daughters
Christabel, Sylvia and Adela, and sons Frank (who died in childhood) and
Harry. Despite her children and other household responsibilities,
Pankhurst remained involved in politics, campaigning for her husband
during his unsuccessful runs for Parliament and hosting political
gatherings at their home. In 1889, Pankhurst became an early supporter
of the Women\'s Franchise League, which wanted to enfranchise all women,
married and unmarried alike (at the time, some groups only sought the
vote for single women and widows). Her husband encouraged Pankhurst in
these endeavors until his death in 1898.

**The WSPU Takes Shape /**Coping with straitened circumstances and grief
consumed much of Pankhurst's attention for the next several years.
However, she retained a passion for women's rights, and in 1903 she
decided to create a new women-only group focused solely on voting
rights, the Women\'s Social and Political Union. The WSPU's slogan was
"Deeds Not Words." In 1905, Pankhurst's daughter Christabel and fellow
WSPU member Annie Kenney went to a meeting to demand if the Liberal
party would support women's suffrage. After a confrontation with the
police, both women were arrested. The attention and interest that
followed this arrest encouraged Pankhurst to have the WSPU follow a more
combative path than other suffrage groups. At first the WSPU's
"militancy" consisted of buttonholing politicians and holding rallies.
Still, following these tactics led to members of Pankhurst's group being
arrested and imprisoned (Pankhurst herself was first sent behind bars in
1908). The *Daily Mail* soon dubbed Pankhurst's group "suffragettes," as
opposed to the "suffragists," who also wanted women to be able to vote
in the United Kingdom, but who followed less confrontational channels.

**Rise of the Suffragettes** /Over the next few years, Pankhurst would
encourage WSPU members to rein in their demonstrations when it seemed
possible that a bill on women's suffrage might move forward. But when
the group was disappointed---as in 1910 and 1911, when Conciliation
Bills that included women's suffrage failed to advance---protests would
escalate. By 1913, militant actions by WSPU members included
window-breaking, vandalizing public art and arson.Throughout these
protests, suffragettes were arrested, but in 1909 the women had begun to
engage in hunger strikes while in prison. Though this resulted in
violent force-feeding, the hunger strikes also led to early release for
many suffragettes. When Pankhurst was given a nine-month sentence in
1912 for throwing a rock at the prime minister's residence, she too
embarked on a hunger strike. Spared from being forcibly fed, she was
soon freed.Seeking to circumvent the hunger strikes, in 1913 the
Prisoners' Temporary Discharge for Ill Health Act was enacted. The law
said that prisoners who were released for health reasons could be
rearrested and taken back to prison once they'd recovered. It became
known as the \"Cat and Mouse Act,\" with suffragette "mice" being
pursued by the authorities. In 1913, after an incendiary device went off
in an unoccupied house being built for the chancellor of the exchequer,
David Lloyd George, Pankhurst received a sentence of three years of
penal servitude for inciting the crime. She was released after a hunger
strike, but the Cat and Mouse Act led to a series of rearrests and
releases---during one furlough, Pankhurst proceeded to the United States
for a fundraising and lecture tour---that continued into 1914. But
everything changed with the arrival of World War I.

## World War I and the Vote

Feeling that suffragettes needed to make sure they had a country to vote
in, Pankhurst decided to call for a halt to militancy and
demonstrations. The government released all WSPU prisoners, and
Pankhurst encouraged women to join the war effort and fill factory jobs
so that men could fight on the front.The contributions of women during
wartime helped convince the British government to grant them limited
voting rights---for those who met a property requirement and were 30
years of age (the voting age for men was 21)---with the Representation
of the People Act of 1918. Later that year, another bill gave women the
right to be elected to Parliament.

## Later Years

Though all her daughters had been members of the WSPU at some point,
Pankhurst was only able to celebrate the achievement of (limited)
suffrage with Christabel, her favorite. As a pacifist, Sylvia had
disagreed with Pankhurst's attitude toward the war, while Adela had
moved to Australia. Pankhurst still desired universal women's suffrage,
but her politics changed focus after the war. She worried about the rise
of Bolshevism and eventually became a member of the Conservative Party.
Pankhurst even ran for a seat in Parliament as a Conservative, but her
campaign was disrupted by ill health (exacerbated by the public
revelation that Sylvia had given birth to an illegitimate child).
Pankhurst was 69 when she died in London on June 14, 1928.Pankhurst did
not live to see it, but on July 2, 1928, Parliament gave women voting
rights on par with those of their male counterparts.

**EMMELINE PANKHURST / A BIOGRAPHY**

Emmeline Pankhurst was a political and social activist who was born in
1858 and founded the Women's Social and Political Union, also known as
« the Suffragette movement », who stood up for/ fought for women's
rights to vote.

She got married to Richard Pankhurst, a lawyer who advocated women's
fuffrage, in 1878. She also gave birth to five children. However, she
remained involved in politics activism. She organized demonstrations and
protests, and even embarked on a hunger strike. She was imprisoned many
times but she saw British Parliament give women limited voting rights in
1918. She died in 1928, a few weeks before British women were given full
voting rights.

Every social studies textbook I remember from my childhood contained
this sentence: \"Dowry (1) is a social evil\". It was mentioned often
alongside « sati », the practice where a widow (2) self-immolate on her
husband\'s funeral pyre (3) as a sign of loyalty. « Sati » is more or
less a thing of the past. It has been accepted as a barbaric practice
that had to end.

But not dowry. The subtext of \"social evil\" when it came to \"dowry\"
is often \"social necessity\".

My sister and I went to the same school and had the same teachers,
though five years apart. Both of us remember our social studies teacher
attempting to justify dowry right after the lesson on \"social evil\".
The teacher said that she would accept dowry for her son and give dowry
when her daughter got married. She said it was basic economics that we
were too young to understand. Instead of being regarded as a crime and a
source of shame, dowry has become a matter of pride. It is not as
discreet as one would expect with an act of illegal transfer of assets
(4). It is flashy and in your face. It is discussed over coffee at
family gatherings. Sons-in-law are often introduced with the price tag
they come with: \"He works in the US. We gave my daughter four crores.\"

Soons are seen as assets. There is a strong preference for male
children, which caused years of « female feticide », that is to say,
forced abortion when the fetus is female, although fetus discrimination
has been illegal in India since 1994. This has left India with a very
unbalanced sex ratio. There are 940 women for every 1,000 men according
to the 2011 census. India has 37 million more men than women, making it
hard for men to find suitable brides (6). In certain parts of the
country, wife sharing among brothers has become common.

Low supply and high demand should have tipped the scales (7) in favour
of women. Yet the dowry market has not seen any discernible drop (8). As
research points out, dowry has become an institutionalized and integral
part of the Indian marriage.

**Kavya Sukumar, www.vox.com, 2017**

Voc : (1) dowry= la dot (= une somme d'argent donnée par la famille de
la future mariée à la famille du futur marié)/ (2) : a widow : une veuve

  1      Dans cet article de 2017, publié sur le site internet

         écrit que
  ------ ----------------------------------------------------------------
  2      Dans son enfance, tous les manuels de SES contenaient le terme
         « mal social »

  3      On appliquait notamment cette expression au « sati »

  4      la pratique selon laquelle une veuve s\'immole sur le bûcher
         funéraire de son mari en signe de loyauté

  5      Le « sati » appartient au passé : on a considéré que c'était une
         pratique barbare qui devait disparaître.

  6      Mais pas la dot.

  7      La dot semble correspondre à une nécessité sociale

  8      Mme Sukumar a cinq ans de différence avec sa sœur,

  9      mais elles sont passées par les mêmes écoles et ont eu les mêmes
         profs

  10     Leur enseignante de SES justifiait la pratique de la dot,

  11     et disait qu'elle accepterait une dot pour son fils et qu'elle
         en donnerait une à sa fille au moment du mariage

  12     Elle disait que c'était une base de l'économie,

  13     Mais que nous étions trop jeunes pour comprendre

  14     La dot n'est pas considérée comme un crime ou une honte,

  15     mais comme une question de fierté

  16     Elle ne se donne pas discrètement, comme on pourrait s'y
         attendre,

  17     Puisqu'il s'agit d'un transfert illégal de biens de
         consommation.

  18     On en parle autour d'un café lors des réunions de famille

  19     On présente les futurs gendres avec l'étiquette qui les
         accompagne, genre,

  20     « Il travaille aux USA. Nous avons donc donné 40 millions de
         roupies à ma fille »

  21     Les gens préfèrent largement avoir un enfant mâle,

  22     ce qui explique que les femmes avortent quand elles apprennent
         que le fétus est une fille,

  23     alors même que la discrimination du fétus est illégale depuis
         1994.

  24     On compte 940 femmes pour 1000 hommes en Inde,

  25     Et il y a 37 million d'hommes de plus que de femmes.

  26     C'est pour cela qu'il est de plus en plus difficile pour les
         hommes de trouver une fiancée.

  27     Dans certaines parties du pays, le partage des épouses entre
         frères est devenu courant

  28     La loi de l'offre et de la demande aurait dû faire pencher la
         balance en faveur des femmes.

  29     Pourtant le marché de la dot n'a pas connu de baisse notable.

  30     La dot est devenue une institution et une partie intégrale du
         mariage indien

SCRIPT /So I'm going to get a little serious here, because I think we
can all agree that this has been a rough week in an already rough
election. This week has been particularly interesting for me personally
because it has been a week of profound contrast.

See, on Tuesday, at the White House, we celebrated the International Day
of the Girl and Let Girls Learn, and it was a wonderful celebration. It
was the last event that I'm going to be doing as first lady for Let
Girls Learn. And I had the pleasure of spending hours talking to some of
the most amazing young women you will ever meet, young girls here in the
US and all around the world. And we talked about their hopes and their
dreams. We talked about their aspirations. See, because many of these
girls have faced unthinkable obstacles just to attend school,
jeopardizing their personal safety, their freedom, risking the rejection
of their families and communities.

So I thought it would be important to remind these young women how
valuable and precious they are. I wanted them to understand that the
measure of any society is how it treats its women and girls. And I told
them that they deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and I
told them that they should disregard anyone who demeans or devalues
them, and that they should make their voices heard in the world. And I
walked away feeling so inspired, just like I'm inspired by all the young
people here -- and I was so uplifted by these girls. That was Tuesday.
And now, here I am, out on the campaign trail in an election where we
have consistently been hearing hurtful, hateful language about women --
language that has been painful for so many of us, not just as women, but
as parents trying to protect our children and raise them to be caring,
respectful adults, and as citizens who think that our nation's leaders
should meet basic standards of human decency.

The fact is that in this election, we have a candidate for president of
the United States who, over the course of his lifetime and the course of
this campaign, has said things about women that are so shocking, so
demeaning that I simply will not repeat anything here today. And last
week, we saw this candidate actually bragging about sexually assaulting
women. And I can't believe that I'm saying that a candidate for
president of the United States has bragged about sexually assaulting
women.And I have to tell you that I can't stop thinking about this. It
has shaken me to my core in a way that I couldn't have predicted. So
while I'd love nothing more than to pretend like this isn't happening,
and to come out here and do my normal campaign speech, it would be
dishonest and disingenuous of me to just move on to the next thing like
this was all just a bad dream.

  10   Elle a insisté sur le fait que la grandeur d'une société se juge
       avant tout à la façon dont les femmes sont traitées.

  11   Elle leur a dit qu'elles devaient être traitées avec dignité et
       respect,

  12   Et qu'elles devaient mépriser ceux qui essayaient de les rabaisser.

  13   Or, aujourd'hui Michelle Obama prend la parole au milieu d'une
       campagne durant laquelle on a entendu beaucoup d'horreurs sur les
       femmes.

  14   Des mots de haine ont été utilisés envers les femmes

  15   Dans des termes qui ont été pénibles à entendre pas seulement pas
       les femmes, mais par tous les parents qui veulent que leurs enfants
       deviennent des adultes responsables et bienveillants

  16   Et par tous les citoyens qui pensent que les dirigeants de ce monde
       doivent se comporter de manière décente.

  17   Elle explique que, dans cette campagne électorale, les Etats-Unis
       ont un candidat qui, tout au long de son existence et tout au long
       de cette campagne,

  18   A dit des choses tellement choquantes et humiliantes pour les
       femmes qu'elle refuse de les répéter.

  19   Et la semaine dernière, nous avons vu ce candidat se vanter d'avoir
       agressé sexuellement des femmes.

  20   Michelle Obama n'en revient pas de dire ça d'un candidat à la
       présidence américaine.

  21   Depuis qu'elle a entendu ces phrases, elle n'arrête pas d'y penser.

  22   Elle a été réellement secouée

  23   Et elle aimerait prétendre que cela n'est pas en train d'arriver

  24   Et continuer la campagne électorale comme si de rien n'était

  25   Mais ce serait malhonnête et hypocrite de faire comme si ce n'était
       qu'un mauvais rêve.

  Discours de Michelle Obama en 2016
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Pendant la campagne électorale

  Parce qu'elle est choquée par les mots employés par Trump

  Pour qualifier les femmes -- langage de haine

  Et parce qu'il s'est vanté d'être un prédateur sexuel

  Alors que Michelle Obama se bat pour que les femmes prennent confiance
  en elles

  Et qu'elle a parlé avec des femmes aux parcours remarquables

  De leurs rêves et de leurs aspiration

#### THE HANDMAID'S TALE- chapter 5

####  The scene is set in the Republic of Gilead, a totalitarian and theocratic state that has replaced the USA. The narrator is called Offred. She is a Handmaid. Because of low reproduction rates, Handmaids are assigned to bear children for elite couples that have trouble conceiving. Offred's freedom, like the freedom of all women, is restricted. The door to her room cannot be completely shut and the Eyes, Gilead's secret police force, watch her every public move. She is only allowed to leave the house to go on shopping trips to buy food and that's what she is doing in chapter 5.

III) REASONS FOR COMING BACK?

IV) HER FEELINGS AND HER REACTIONS ?

This song which has become one of the best-known songs in the world was
first sung by Gloria Gaynor, an African-American disco singer in 1978
but it was taken up again by many other singers ever since (including
the famous version by Hermes House Band which became the anthem of the
French Football Team in 1998).

It relates the story of a woman who after being **dumped** (=larguée) by
her lover, decides to resist and refuses to **collapse/crumble**. She
fights so as to **start over** and begin a new life and when her former
lover returns, sad and **shameful**, a few years later, she **kicks him
out** of the house and shows him how much she has changed.

He **must have left her** because he had found a younger and more
gorgeous/ attractive/ a sexier girlfriend .He **may have been** bored
with living with her .He didn't love her anymore, so he decided to
**break off**

He has come back because he realised that she was the love of his life
and that he had **made a blunder** when he left her

He **may have been** dumped by his new girlfriend who **walked down on**
him when she saw what sort of man he was

He may be broke and homeless and needs **a shelter**

However, the singer refuses to welcome him and objects to living with
him again. She's **upset** because he **dares to show up** (= il ose se
pointer) has **stepped into** her house with her old key . She's still
**cross at** him for having left her

At the same time she must be **delighted** to see him suffer and to
**take her revenge/ get even**

Oklahoma governor signs the nation\'s strictest abortion ban

May 26, 2022 www.npr.com

OKLAHOMA CITY --- Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt on Wednesday signed into law
the nation\'s strictest abortion ban, making the state the first in the
nation to effectively end availability of the procedure.

State lawmakers [approved the
ban](https://www.npr.org/2022/05/19/oklahoma-legislature-passes-bill-banning-nearly-all-abortions) enforced
by civil lawsuits rather than criminal prosecution, similar to a Texas
law that was passed last year. The law takes effect immediately upon
Stitt\'s signature and prohibits all abortions with few exceptions.
Abortion providers have said they will stop performing the procedure as
soon as the bill is signed.

\"I promised Oklahomans that as governor I would sign every piece of
pro-life legislation that came across my desk and I am proud to keep
that promise today,\" the first-term Republican said in a statement.
\"From the moment life begins at conception is when we have a
responsibility as human beings to do everything we can to protect that
baby\'s life and the life of the mother. That is what I believe and that
is what the majority of Oklahomans believe.\"

Abortion providers across the country have been bracing for the
possibility that the U.S. Supreme Court\'s new conservative majority
might further restrict the practice, and that has especially been the
case in Oklahoma and Texas.

\"The impact will be disastrous for Oklahomans,\" said Elizabeth Nash, a
state policy analyst for the abortion-rights supporting Guttmacher
Institute. \"It will also have severe ripple effects, especially for
Texas patients who had been traveling to Oklahoma in large numbers after
the Texas six-week abortion ban went into effect in September.\"

The bills are part of an aggressive push in Republican-led states to
scale back abortion rights. It comes on the heels of a leaked draft
opinion from the nation\'s high court that suggests justices are
considering weakening or overturning the landmark Roe v. Wade decision
that legalized abortion nearly 50 years ago.

The only exceptions in the Oklahoma law are to save the life of a
pregnant woman or if the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest that
has been reported to law enforcement.

The bill specifically authorizes doctors to remove a \"dead unborn child
caused by spontaneous abortion,\" or miscarriage, or to remove an
ectopic pregnancy, a potentially life-threatening emergency that occurs
when a fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, often in a fallopian
tube and early in pregnancy.

The law also does not apply to the use of morning-after pills such as
Plan B or any type of contraception. Two of Oklahoma\'s four abortion
clinics already stopped providing abortions after the governor signed a
six-week ban earlier this month. With the state\'s two remaining
abortion clinics expected to stop offering services, it is unclear what
will happen to women who qualify under one of the exceptions. The law\'s
author, State Rep. Wendi Stearman, says doctors will be empowered to
decide which women qualify and that those abortions will be performed in
hospitals. But providers and abortion-rights activists warn that trying
to prove qualification could prove difficult and even dangerous in some
circumstances.

In addition to the Texas-style bill already signed into law, the measure
is one of at least three anti-abortion bills sent this year to Stitt.

Oklahoma\'s law is styled after a first-of-its-kind Texas law that the
U.S. Supreme Court has allowed to remain in place that allows private
citizens to sue abortion providers or anyone who helps a woman obtain an
abortion. Other Republican-led states sought to copy Texas\' ban.
Idaho\'s governor signed the first copycat measure in March, although it
has been temporarily blocked by the state\'s Supreme Court

The third Oklahoma bill is to take effect this summer and would make it
a felony to perform an abortion, punishable by up to 10 years in prison.
That bill contains no exceptions for rape or incest.

This document is an article taken from npr.com and posted in March 2025.
It deals with the new law that was passed in by Senator Kevin Stitt.
This law makes it extremely difficult for women to have an abortion in
Oklahoma. This law will be applied in a few weeks and there will be many
exceptions to it. Kevin Stitt is embarrassed because he thinks that most
of the inhabitants of the state disagree with him. The same sort of law
will be adopted in Texas next fall.

Traite de la nouvelle loi qui vient d'être votée

En Oklahoma par le gouverneur Kevin Stitt

Cette loi interdit tous les avortements

A quelques rares exceptions près,

Par exemple quand la vie de la mère est en danger

Ou en cas de viol ou d'inceste, si l'affaire a été portée devant les
tribunaux.

Le gouverneur est très fier, car il pense que cette loi est le reflet du
souhait des habitants de l'état.

Cette loi est identique à la loi votée au Texas en septembre dernier.

Il s'agit donc d'une offensive conjointe, menée contre l'avortement par
les états gouvernés par les Républicains.

Les 4 cliniques d'Oklahoma qui opéraient des avortements vont donc
cesser d'offrir leurs services et on ne sait pas ce qui va arriver aux
femmes qui font partie des exceptions définies par la nouvelle loi.

This document is an article taken from npr.com and posted in March 2025.
It deals with the new law that was passed in by Senator Kevin Stitt.
This law makes it extremely difficult for women to have an abortion in
Oklahoma. This law will be applied in a few weeks and there will be many
exceptions to it. Kevin Stitt is embarrassed because he thinks that most
of the inhabitants of the state disagree with him. The same sort of law
will be adopted in Texas next fall.

        Ce document est une interview de Margaret Atwood
  ----- -----------------------------------------------------------------
  1     dans laquelle elle détaille ses trois sources d'inspiration

  2     pour l'écriture de la Serveuse Ecarlate.

  3     Elle explique d'abord qu'elle s'est basée sur ses études sur les
        Etats-Unis aux 17 ème siècle,

  4     et sur le fait qu'au départ, les Etats-Unis étaient une
        théocratie,

  5     fondée par les Puritains en Nouvelle-Angleterre,

  6     et non une république créée au XVIIIème siècle (et inspirée par
        le Siècle des Lumières)

  7     Cette tendance n'arrête pas de ressortir à intervalles réguliers
        aux Etats-Unis.

  8     Sa seconde source d'inspiration vient de ses lectures d'utopies
        et de dystopies.

  9     Elle en a beaucoup lu,

  10    et a toujours voulu en écrire une

  11    Mais toutes celles qu'elle avait lu avaient un narrateur masculin

  12    et elle souhaitait changer la perspective avec une narratrice (au
        sein d'une théocratie)

  13    La troisième source d'inspiration est ce qu'il se passait déjà
        dans les années 80,

  14    où, dans les journaux et les magazines ( dont elle découpait les
        articles alors),

  15    certaines personnes disaient ce qu'elles aimeraient faire si
        elles parvenaient au pouvoir.

  16    Or maintenant cette frange/fraction de la population est
        effectivement au pouvoir.

  17    Margaret Atwood insiste sur le fait qu'elle n'a rien mis dans ce
        livre,

  18    qui ne se soit déjà effectivement passé

  19    quelque part sur terre, à un moment donné de l'Histoire,

  20    ou qui n'était pas en train de se passer pendant qu'elle écrivait
        le livre.

  21    Donc tout est basé sur la réalité.

  22    Ce qu'elle ne voulait pas entendre, c'est qu'elle avait une
        imagination tordue

  23    Et que les gens ne feraient jamais des choses pareilles

  24    Donc, elle n'a mis que des choses que les gens avaient déjà
        effectivement commises.

**FINAL TASK**

Coffee filters, windscreen wipers (=essuie-glace), language programming
or computer software -- all those inventions have one thing in common :
they were all imagined, created or designed by women. However, in spite
of their immense contributions to the advances in technology, in
science, in arts, in politics, in economics and so on, many women are
still not recognised or credited for what they did.

It's high time you stood up for their rights.

In pairs, you will make research and then write an article ( of about
one page) about one of those women, so that people know about their
existence and their achievements. You will of course, sum up their life,
but you will also try to undestand (if you can) why they were
obliterated and by whom.

Here is a list of the women you can write about (but of course, if
you've heard about other women or if, during your research, you find a
woman whose name has been forgotten, you can write about her) :

A)  SCIENTISTS :

HYPATIA OF ALEXANDRIA / MARGARET HAMILTON /BESSIE COLEMAN/ FLORENCE
NIGHTINGALE / ROSALIND FRANKLIN / KATHERINE JOHNSON- MARY JACKSON AND
DOROTHY VAUGHAN

B)  POLITICIANS, WARRIORS AND ADVENTURERS :

BOUDICCA/ NADEZHDA DUROVA/ LASKARINA BOUBOULINA/ SEMIRAMIS/ PETRA
HERRERA

C ) PHILOSOPHERS AND ACTIVISTS

MARY WOOLLSTONECRAFT/ FATIMA AL-FIHRI / HARRIET TUBMAN

D)  ARTISTS

NANNERL MOZART /FANNY MENDELSSOHN/ DELIA DERBYSHIRE / ZELDA FITZGERALD

E)  SPORTSWOMEN /BILLY JEAN KING / WILMA RUDOLPH
